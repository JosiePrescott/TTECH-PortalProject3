This creates 3 cards that link to different projects I've done throughout the semester.
The projects can be access by flipping the cards or through the links on the navigation bar.
JavaScript handles all the links and titles, the HTML is pretty much empty.
JavaScript also creates the footer which shows when it was last updated.
The links to projects will open in a new tab so you are able to view all projects.
The Portal Project title doesn't link anywhere since you don't need to navigate on the page because links open in new tabs.
Here is the link to the working website: https://josieprescott.github.io/TTECH-PortalProject3/
